# User Story:
------------
- As a user I would want to add events to a calendar to manage time as efficiently and effectively as possible.
--------------------------------------

# How To Use:
-------------
- Once presented with the calendar and daily time slots you will be able to select times in increments of 30 minutes. Once you select your desired time slot you can click in the text box and add notes or any information you want to display to be reminded of when to tackle certain tasks. Once you have entered in the information you will have the option to save it directly to the dedicated time slot by clicking the checkmark. Similarly to clear the information you can click the back arrow with the X inside to reset the time slot.
